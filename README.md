# TNSS4A
TN SS4A eligibility assessment
* This repository includes my workflow for converting pipe delimited `.txt` files to `.csv` files that can be processed, and data cleaning for counts of crashes. City codes are listed in the included `.txt` file. 
* The repository includes Python and R script
* `dplyr` syntax is used throughout the simple R script, rather than using base R. If you do not have the `tidyverse` family of packages installed, the code to install is `install.packages('tidyverse')`
