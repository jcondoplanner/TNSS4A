# TNSS4A
TN SS4A eligibility assessment
* This repository documents my workflow for converting pipe-delimited `.txt` files to `.csv` files that can be processed, and data cleaning for counts of crashes. City codes are listed in the included `.txt` file. The purpose of this repository is a personal record of the workflow and accessibility if this process needs to be repeated in other states by other employees.  
* The repository includes Python and R script
* `dplyr` syntax is used throughout the simple R script, rather than using base R. If you do not have the `tidyverse` family of packages installed, the code to install is `install.packages('tidyverse')`
* Data source: https://titan.safety.tn.gov/Areas/Public/Support/TITAN_Extract_CrashData_10_years.zip
